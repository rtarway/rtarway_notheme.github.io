Data engineering is all about making the data ready for Business Analytics, AI and ML. It typically involves getting the data from varied sources, transform and enrich, and load (ETL- Extract, Transform, Load) into target sync which could be EDW like BigQuery or Snowflake. Sometimes, we can transform the existing data to make it suitable for different purposes , such transformations may be called ELT - Extract, Load and Transform in contrast to ETL  

Dataflow in google cloud is a serverless data engineering service to achieve ETL or ELT operations at scale.
